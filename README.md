The Big-O Analyzer is a web tool designed to evaluate the time complexity of code snippets. Users can select a programming language, input their code, and receive the Big-O notation output. This tool aids users in comprehending and optimizing their algorithms effectively.

## About

The web tool aims to assist programmers in understanding the efficiency of their code by providing insights into the time complexity through Big-O notation analysis. Users can make informed decisions about optimizing their algorithms based on the results generated by the Big-O Analyzer.

## Features

- Input code snippets in various programming languages
- Receive Big-O notation evaluation for the input code
- Enhance algorithm efficiency with insights on time complexity analysis

## Getting Started

To get started with using the Big-O Analyzer, simply visit the web tool at [runtime-analyzer.vercel.app](runtime-analyzer.vercel.app). Select your desired programming language, input your code snippet, and let the tool provide you with the Big-O notation analysis.
